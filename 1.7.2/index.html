          The desire to be respected by someone of the opposite Res pect
          Vielaalclal sex is something that runs deep within everyone, even
          though most people don't take the time to find someone who truly
          respects them. It seems like people are just looking for someone to
          show them the slightest amount of attention, settling for something
          much less than respect. I am convinced one of the best ways to help
          any relationship grow is by showing respect.

          I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be respected.
          What is respect? Respect is showing someone extra special attention,
          or high regard, based on a desire to show them how highly they are
          valued.
